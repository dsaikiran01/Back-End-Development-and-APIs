# Back End Development and APIs

Welcome to my **FreeCodeCamp Back End Development and APIs** repository! üöÄ

This repository contains five projects built using **Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB** as part of FreeCodeCamp's Back End Development and APIs Certification. These projects explore server-side programming, API creation, and database interaction, providing a hands-on approach to building backend applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for server-side execution
- **Express.js** - Web framework for building APIs
- **MongoDB & Mongoose** - NoSQL database and ODM for data handling
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** - Basic frontend for testing APIs
- **multer** - Middleware for handling file uploads
- **Postman** - API testing and development tool

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/dsaikiran01/Back-End-Development-and-APIs.git
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Back-End-Development-and-APIs
   ```
3. Navigate to the respective project folder:
   ```sh
   cd project-folder-name
   cd Project-4-Exercise Tracker
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
5. Start MongoDB server and create a database named `FCC-Backend-Certification`. The backend will create its own collections automatically.
6. Start the server:
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
7. If you don't want to use the frontend UI, you can use **Postman** to test the APIs. Simply use `localhost:3000` or the port shown in the console and append the respective endpoints to test them.

## üéØ Conclusion

These projects helped me strengthen my backend development skills, API handling, and database management. Each project demonstrates a practical use case for backend systems in modern web applications.
